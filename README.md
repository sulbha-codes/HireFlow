 # HireFlow – Job Discovery Platform

HireFlow is a frontend job discovery application built using React and Tailwind CSS.  
It allows users to browse job listings, filter them by category, save jobs, and simulate applying for a position — all with a clean and responsive UI.

This project focuses on frontend architecture, UI behavior, and state management, simulating how a real job portal works.

## How It Works

- Job data is stored locally (mock API)
- Jobs are fetched asynchronously
- Users can:
  - Search jobs
  - Filter by category
  - Save jobs
  - View saved jobs
  - Apply via a demo page
- Saved jobs persist using localStorage

---

## Why Mock Data?

This project focuses on frontend development.

In real-world applications:
- Job data comes from backend APIs
- Authentication & data storage are handled server-side

Mock data is used to:
- Simulate real API behavior
- Avoid CORS issues
- Focus on UI, state, and logic

## What I Learned

- React component structure
- State management & filtering
- React Router for navigation
- Handling UI states (loading, empty, error)
- Working with localStorage
- Building real-world frontend features

## Future Improvements

- Pagination
- Search by company
- Sort by latest jobs
- Backend integration
- Authentication
- Job application form
